A simple single-page React web app thought to be set as a browser homepage.

## Features

- Possibility to search on more than 22 websites
- Possibility to use filters (aka options)
- Automatic dark mode (following your system's mode)
- Possibility to use a specific domain (.com, .co.uk, ...) if the search engine supports it (it can be set in the settings)
- Random font each time page is reloaded (who wants the same identical homepage each time?)
- Clean UI (not a feature and pretty subjective, I know ðŸ˜‰)
- Responsive

## OK but ... how does it work?

`website [option] query`

1. Write website initials (website's logo will appear)
2. Optionally write website's option initials (option's name will appear)
3. Write search query
4. Press ENTER

By default Google search is used and it is used also when no match is found for the initials inserted (meaning that probably you are already writing your search query).

To set this website as new tab page in Chrome, you have to use an extension like [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna).

### Examples

`gi the homepage` will search `the homepage` on GitHub

`gi us leobel96` will search `leobel96` as user on GitHub
